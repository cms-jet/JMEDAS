    "# Jet Types and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The jet algorithms take as input a set of 4-vectors. At CMS, the most popular jet type is the \"Particle Flow Jet\", which attempts to use the entire detector at once and derive single four-vectors representing specific particles.For this reason it is very comparable (ideally) to clustering generator-level four-vectors also.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Particle Flow Jets (PFJets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Particle Flow candidates (PFCandidates) combine information from various detectors to make a combined estimation of particle properties based on their assigned identities (photon, electron, muon, charged hadron, neutral hadron).\n",
    "\n",
    "PFJets are created by clustering PFCandidates into jets, and contain information about contributions of every particle class: Electromagnetic/hadronic, Charged/neutral etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jet response is high. The jet pT resolution is good: starting at 15--20% at low pT and asymptotically reaching 5% at high pT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monte Carlo Generator-level Jets (GenJets)\n",
    "\n",
    "GenJets are pure Monte Carlo simulated jets. They are useful for analysis with MC samples. GenJets are formed by clustering the four-momenta of Monte Carlo truth particles. This may include “invisible” particles (muons, neutrinos, WIMPs, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are no detector effects involved, the jet response (or jet energy scale) is 1, and the jet resolution is perfect, by definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "GenJets include information about the 4-vectors of the constituent particles, the hadronic and electromagnetic components of the energy etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calorimeter Jets (CaloJets)\n",
    "\n",
    "CaloJets are formed from energy deposits in the calorimeters (hadronic and electromagnetic), with no tracking information considered. In the barrel region, a calorimeter tower consists of a single HCAL cell and the associated 5x5 array of ECAL crystals (the HCAL-ECAL association is similar but more complicated in the endcap region). The four-momentum of a tower is assigned from the energy of the tower, assuming zero mass, with the direction corresponding to the tower position from the interaction point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CMS, CaloJets are used less often than PFJets. Examples of their use include performance studies to disentangle tracker and calorimeter effects, and trigger-level analyses where the tracker is neglected to reduce the event processing time. ATLAS makes much more use of CaloJets, as their version of particle flow is not as mature as CMS's."

    "# Jet Clustering Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of jet algorithms at CMS use a so-called \"clustering sequence\". This is essentially a pairwise examination of the input four-vectors. If the pair satisfy some criteria, they are merged. The process is repeated until the entire list of constituents is exhausted. In addition, there are several ways to determine the \"area\" of the jet over which the input constituents lay. This is very important in correcting for pileup, as we will see, because some algorithms tend to \"consume\" more constituents than others and hence are more susceptible to pileup. Furthermore, the amount of energy that is inside of a jet due to pileup is proportional to the area, so to correct for this effect it is very important to know the jet area.\n",

    "In order to avoid using fake jets, which can originate from a hot calorimeter cell or electronic read-out box, we need to require some basic quality criteria for jets. These criteria are collectively called \"jet ID\". Details on the jet ID for PFJets can be found in the following twiki:\n",
